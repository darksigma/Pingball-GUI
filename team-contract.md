# Pingball (Phase 2) Team Contract

### Natasha Consul, Nikhil Buduma, Prafulla Dhariwal

## Goals

Our goal is to get the work done, write quality code for a pinball GUI,
and learn about software engineering and collaboration from each other. We all
want to do well, but we understand that some people may be busy at times, so we
are not expecting that everybody is doing the same amount of work on every
aspect of the project. However, we expect roughly equal contributions from the
team members.

We are all willing to work hard enough to earn an A.

## Meeting Norms

We will be meeting during 6.005 lecture hours. When we meet outside of lecture,
 we will schedule a time to meet in the student center.

We will use in-class working time to do high-level design, write skeleton code,
and do other work that requires in-person collaboration. For the most part, we
will write code asynchronously and separately and collaborate over git.

## Work Norms

We are expecting to spend approximately 20+ hours per week per person to make
this project successful.

We will make decisions as a group, and we will try to have every group member
agree on the decision we make. We will record who is responsible for each task 
in this contract once we decide it.

We will try to have all code reviewed by at least one group member (besides the
author). If there are disagreements about the quality of the code, we will work
to improve the code until everyone is happy.

We all have fairly similar work habits. We are planning on getting the project
done early so that we have time to polish it.

## Decision Making

When making decisions, we will try our best to have concensus. In the event
that this does not occur, we will go with what the majority decides.
