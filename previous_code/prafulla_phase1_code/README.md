Notes
-----

In addition to unit testing, to ensure correctness of our code, we ran a static
analysis tool [findbugs][findbugs] and a code coverage tool [jacoco][jacoco] on
our code.

The results of running these tools on our latest code (c655a55) can be found
[here][results].

There is not much found by the static analysis tool in the latest version of
our code because we have fixed all the bugs found by the tool. We continuously
used both tools as we were developing our code.
